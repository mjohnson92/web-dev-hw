*To start, I've recently learned a little bit more about HTML. I know have been taught several new tags to format the way text looks in HTML. Specifically semantics such as how to bolden text, emphasize text (italics), superscript and subscript text.*

*I decided that I would like a physical copy of the course text instead of reading the .pdf so i ordered one. I think a physical copy of the book will help me with my assignments. Although, you can copy and paste the code from the .pdf I've realized, that doesn't actually help you remember any of it. Manually reading and typing the code will help me learn and remember the tags much more efficently in the long run.*
