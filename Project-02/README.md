### Learning
*To start, I've recently learned a little bit more about HTML. I know have been taught several new tags to format the way text looks in HTML. Specifically semantics such as how to bolden text, emphasize text (italics), superscript and subscript text.*

*I decided that I would like a physical copy of the course text instead of reading the .pdf so i ordered one. I think a physical copy of the book will help me with my assignments. Although, you can copy and paste the code from the .pdf I've realized, that doesn't actually help you remember any of it. Manually reading and typing the code will help me learn and remember the tags much more efficently in the long run.*

### Brainstorming & Researching
*After reading what my assignment would be, I was excited to continue to dive into HTML. I looked at the projects that had already been submitted and nearly all of them were cooking recipes. I decided that I didn't want to do that because it was already coming up so much and I don't really like to cook anyways. I researched ideas, following trails of pinterest arts and crafts directions but didn't care for any of them.*

*Last night I stayed up late and decided to watch **The Prestige** and absolutely enjoyed it. It's probably a new favorite at this point. Anyways, based off of that event I decided to make my project 2 Instructable to be a simple card trick.*
