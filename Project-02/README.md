### Learning
---
*To start, I've recently learned a little bit more about HTML. I know have been taught several new tags to format the way text looks in HTML. Specifically semantics such as how to bolden text, emphasize text (italics), superscript and subscript text.*

*I decided that I would like a physical copy of the course text instead of reading the .pdf so i ordered one. I think a physical copy of the book will help me with my assignments. Although, you can copy and paste the code from the .pdf I've realized, that doesn't actually help you remember any of it. Manually reading and typing the code will help me learn and remember the tags much more efficently in the long run.*

### Brainstorming & Researching
---
*After reading what my assignment would be, I was excited to continue to dive into HTML. I looked at the projects that had already been submitted and nearly all of them were cooking recipes. I decided that I didn't want to do that because it was already coming up so much and I don't really like to cook anyways. I researched ideas, following trails of pinterest arts and crafts directions but didn't care for any of them.*

*Last night I stayed up late and decided to watch **The Prestige** and absolutely enjoyed it. It's probably a new favorite at this point. Anyways, based off of that event I decided to make my Project 2 Instructable to be a simple card trick.*

### Coding
---
*The coding for this **HW-01** went rather smoothly. The header, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the meta information. But when every time I go over it it starts to make more sense. I will need to review **Duckett** every now and then.*

## **Week 2**
---
### Learning
---
**There was a lot to learn this week.** *It was hard to keep up with all the new additions to the web page. Although they are simple it's wasy to mix up a the forms. This week was particularly hard because I had to try to learn things a lot more quickly due to getting married this weekend and having family in town. I had to do the assignment last minute which I do not recommend. I enjoyed learning about the forms and tables though. It's fun to actually have a few different pages now. Next week I hope to be a lot more free with my schedule so I can step it up and make my page even better and advanced. I will have to play catch up I think when it comes to making more forms.*

### Coding

*The coding for this **HW-02** was a little trouble some at times now that there is a lot going on in the html. It's becoming so long and so many different things are happening now but I'm still not completely lost in the code yet.*
