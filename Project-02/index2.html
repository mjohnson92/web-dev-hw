      <p align="center">The <dfn><abbr title="Best Easy Card Trick">B.E.C.T.</abbr></dfn> is a trick where the magician picks a
        <i>shuffled</i> card out of the deck<br />
            that the audience has chosen out of the <strong>3</strong> options given at the start.<br />
            Also, the magician will make the card <strong><sup>rise</sup></strong> out of the deck at the end for an even better surprise.<br /></p>

                <li> At least one witness </li>
                <li> Lighting in your favor </li>
                <li> Quick Hands </li>
                <li> Practice </li>
                <li> The magician's <i>spirit!</i> </li>
                <li> A deck of cards </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Poker Size (3.5" x 2.25") </li>
                    <li> Bridge Size (3.5" x 2.5") </li>
                  </ul>
              </ol>

          <h2 align="Center">Directions</h2>
      <ol>
    <li>Show the audience it's a normal deck of cards </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Show with your hands that there is nothing special about the deck</li>
      <li>After showing, prepare your hands for the trick</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Display <strong>3</strong> cards from the back of the deck, Hiding a <strong>4<sup>th</sup></strong> at the back</li>
    <ul>
      <li>To start, pull the back card from the deck down an inch but still make sure its hidden</li>
      <li>Next, pull the <strong>3</strong> next cards from the back of the deck upwards (leaving them in the deck) and shift them so they can be identified</li>
      <li>Ask the audience to pick <strong>1</strong> of the <strong>3</strong> cards you've pulled outward</li>
      <ol>
        <li><em>You do not need to know the card</em></li>
        <li><em>You only need to remember its position</em></li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <li>Square the cards and count in as they are faced down</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowing the position of the card <strong>(1,2,3)</strong>, count in to the position while disposing the cards into the deck</li>
      <li>Remember, there was an extra card in the back so when you finish counting in and shuffing the cards, the card they chose will be on top.</li>
      <li>The audience will think the card they chose will be shuffled in the deck</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Face the cards back to the audience and tap a finger on the deck <strong>3</strong> times</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Tap your pointer finger on the deck <strong>3</strong> times</li>
      <li>On the <strong>3<sup>rd</sup></strong> slowly raise the back card with your pinky and the pointer finger</li>
    </ul>
      </ol>
