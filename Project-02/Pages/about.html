           The website was created to help people learn a simple card trick.
             It doesn't matter if you have little to no experience, it is easy enough for anyone to learn.
              I chose this topic because a couple of nights before the website was first assigned,
                I had watched the film called <strong>The Presitge</strong> by Christopher Nolan.
                  After being mesmerized by how incredible the film was, I decided that magic is what
                   I would try to explore as something that could be taught.

             I hope that this instructable website has enough information to help
               you learn something new. The process of creating this page has been fun and a great learning
                experience. My goal is to not forget too much by the time we start our next project! There is
                  quite a bit of information to take in but I think we have a lot of great resources to stay
                    confident with html.

                      By the way, let me introduce myself. My name is Michael Johnson, I'm 25 years old
                        and am currently attending the <strong> University of Montana </strong>. Here are some random facts
                          about me so I'm not such a stranger. I have a few hobbies, I love to listen to music, create music,
                            look at art, create art, watch movies, skateboard, and relax! Due to this course being online, I
                              won't be meeting classmates any time soon so I thought it would be appropriate to say something about
                                myself here. Hope everyone is enjoying the class!
